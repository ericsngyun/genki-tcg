# ============================================================================
# RAILWAY BACKEND ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================================================
# Copy this file to .env when you want frontends to connect to Railway backend
# Use this when you DON'T want to run the backend locally
#
# Quick Start:
# 1. cp .env.railway.example .env
# 2. Update frontend .env files to point to Railway:
#    - apps/admin-web/.env.local: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://genki-tcg-production.up.railway.app
#    - apps/mobile/.env: EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://genki-tcg-production.up.railway.app
# 3. Run frontends only: npm run dev:admin or npm run dev:mobile
# ============================================================================

# NOTE: You don't need most environment variables when using Railway backend
# The backend is already running on Railway with its own configuration

# Railway Backend URL (for reference only - not used by backend)
RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL="https://genki-tcg-production.up.railway.app"

# Discord OAuth - Same as production
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="1441953820820373639"
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="your-discord-client-secret-from-portal"

# Environment
NODE_ENV="development"

# NOTE: When using Railway backend, you typically won't run the backend locally,
# so DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc. are not needed in this file.
# Those are configured in Railway's environment variables.
